I"Ä<p>TheÂ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/sports/football/nfl-roundup.html?_r=0" rel="external">extra point is now pointless</a>, according to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Being someone that is typicallyÂ <a href="/tag/sports-reform/" rel="external">pro rule change</a>Â this is music to my ears. However, Goodellâ€™s proposal Â just feels wrong. Here it is summed up: AÂ touchdown is automatically worth 7 points, unless the scoring teams attempts to run an additional play for an attempt at an additional point, but if that play is unsuccessful you lose a point. Please try to explain that to a non-football fan. It would just add to an increasingly confusing and over regulated rule book.</p>
