I"≤<p>As a new dad, I have been exposed to a new world of books. Namely, books designed for babies. My daughter is now nearly five months old and is beginning to touch everything and put everything into her mouth. I‚Äôm beginning to learn that the baby book industry (aka ‚ÄòBig Baby Book‚Äô) is catering to this high demand. Pages are typically indestructible and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">edible</span> chewable.<!--more--></p>

<p>The book I‚Äôd like to review for you is entitled <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Animals-Baby-Touch-Feel-Publishing/dp/0756634687/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332903862&amp;sr=8-1">Baby Touch and Feel Animals</a></em>. Really I think it should be titled <em>Baby Touch and Feel: Animals</em>, because the back of the book says it is a part of a series. Colons are important, especially in books of so few words.</p>

<p>The author is.. Actually I don‚Äôt know who the author is because it doesn‚Äôt say on the cover. This is gravely concerning to me. All books have an author. In most adult books the author‚Äôs name is usually bigger than the title. So what happened to this author? Someone had to to write this book, right? This leads me to assume one of the following: (See, colons are important!)</p>

<ul>
  <li>The author is embarrassed by their work. This is very likely considering the text consists mostly of repeatable animal sounds. This probably isn‚Äôt what the author had in mind when they took a job at a publishing house, but still it is a published piece of work. We can‚Äôt take that away.</li>
  <li>This leads me to think a ghostwriter was used. Oh wait, nevermind I just found the author information. It‚Äôs on the back cover in 8 point font. &lt;ul style="border: none; margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;"&gt;
    <li>
    Design: Victoria Harvey

    <li>
    Text: Dawn Sirett (Ghostwriter???)
  </li>
    <li>
    U.S. Editor: Jennifer Quasasha
  </li>
    <p>&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: U.S. editor? Has this book really gone to print in other languages? Are animal sounds translatable? Doesn‚Äôt a cat say ‚Äúmeow‚Äù in French? Rachel is telling me animals do make different sounds in other countries, who knew? I do suppose a cat would say ‚ÄúMao‚Äù in Mandarin Chinese.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moving on, this book starts off strong with a cat and dog. Both animals are furry, allowing for a baby to take easy enjoyment from petting the fake fur of each. However, as I continued to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">read</span> check for texture in the book, I‚Äôm sorry to say, it goes a bit downhill with a blend of flat, texture-less stickers on cardboard stock and repeats of the dog/cat felt texture on animals such as penguins and monkeys.</p>

<p>Yet, there is one unexpected bright spot and that goes to the starfish. It was the most unique texture in the book. I just wish there were was more of where this came from.</p>

<p>The biggest disappointment of all is when the final page of 12 finally arrives and are in anticipation of the grand finale, and BOOM, you get a snail. Really, a snail? It‚Äôs kind of like reaching the end of the Hunger Games¬†trilogy‚Ä¶ Wait no it isn‚Äôt.</p>

<p>To conclude, I give the book a ‚ÄúC‚Äù for standard chew toy fare.</p>

<p>Still want to buy this book after this savagery? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Animals-Baby-Touch-Feel-Publishing/dp/0756634687/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332903862&amp;sr=8-1">Go here</a>.</p>

<p>How do you find this critique? Is it fair? Do you want me to review more books that really don‚Äôt need to be reviewed? Please let me know in the comments below.</p>
