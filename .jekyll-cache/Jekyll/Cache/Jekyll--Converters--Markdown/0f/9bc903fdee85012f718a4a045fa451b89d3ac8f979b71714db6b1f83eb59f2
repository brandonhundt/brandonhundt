It was exciting basketball played at a high quality. Spain is simply an incredible team, featuring the Gasol brothers and four other current NBA players (and a few former ones too). They ended up defeating Tony Parker, Joakim Noah, Nicolas Batum, and the rest of France in the title game. Thatâ€™s a lot of talent. It proves that the the rest of the world is catching up to US.<!--more--></p>
