I"�<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/sports/football/nfl-roundup.html?_r=0" rel="external">extra point is now pointless</a>, according to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Being someone that is typically <a hrefhttps://brandonhundt.com/m/tag/sports-reform/" rel="external">pro rule change</a> this is music to my ears. However, Goodell’s proposal  just feels wrong. Here it is summed up: A touchdown is automatically worth 7 points, unless the scoring teams attempts to run an additional play for an attempt at an additional point, but if that play is unsuccessful you lose a point. Please try to explain that to a non-football fan. It would just add to an increasingly confusing and over regulated rule book.</p>
