I"Ñ<p>In a <a href="/why-not-my-quest-to-realign-the-50-states/">recent blog post</a> I redrew the imaginary lines that make up the 50 states. This exercise created a buzz of discussion (8 comments is a lot for this blog) and brought out some state pride and disagreement from the readers. I would like the readership to know that Iâ€™m prepared to stand behind, on top of, or in the map I redrew with a few adjustments based on the received feedback.
