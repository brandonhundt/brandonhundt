I"ç<p>Lately there has been <a href="http://fourfourtwo.com/news/restofeurope/73566/default.aspx" rel="external">some talk coming from Barcelona</a> saying they would like to see an expanded Champions League at the expense of a shortened La Liga. I have to say that I am in favor of this. I am even in favor of going so far in creating an European Super League. I would much rather see a Barca/Arsenal match-up more often than watch Barca whoop up on another low-level Spanish club like Levante. And to think Barca could play Chelsea, Man United, Liverpool, AC Milan, Inter, and the likes of Bayern Munich on a weekly basis gets me excited.<!--more--></p>
