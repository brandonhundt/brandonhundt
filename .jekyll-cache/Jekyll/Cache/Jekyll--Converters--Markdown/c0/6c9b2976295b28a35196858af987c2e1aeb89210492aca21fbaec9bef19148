I"<p>As a Bears fan living in the Twin Cities I canâ€™t stand the Vikings. They regularly annoy me to the core of my being. While that statement may be a bit dramatic, I can honestly say I dislike them more than the Packers (albeit not much more). However, I donâ€™t want to see them become the second Minneapolis team to find themselves wearing purple and gold in Los Angeles. It just doesnâ€™t seem right for such an established entity that has such a high cultural value to the state to all the sudden be gone.<!--more--></p>
