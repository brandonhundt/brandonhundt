    <p>It is now official, I am running for the office of the FIFA President. FIFA has the distinct privilege to govern the world’s most popular and talked about game. Even if you only know a little bit about association football, you can join a conversation with almost anyone in this world, even the in the United States.</p>

<p>However, FIFA has become a <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/accused-fifa-executive-citing-onion-says-u-s-hosting-world-n367401">joke</a> with its obvious and over the top corruption and archaic ideas. It is an organization straight out of the 1900s. Enough is enough. By electing me President, I will usher in a new age of governance and innovation, and with your support, I will lead FIFA as it joins most of the rest of the world in this millennium.</p>

<p>Here is the <em><strong>tl;dr</strong></em> version of my platform as FIFA President:</p>

<h4 id="1-increase-the-transparency-consistency-and-fairness-of-fifa">1. Increase the transparency, consistency, and fairness of FIFA:</h4>

<ul style="margin-top: 0;">
  <li>
    Open up the books.
  </li>
  <li>
    Establish term limits for the President and ExCo members
  </li>
  <li>
    Create standards for spending requirements of money given to members. Ensure this information is public record and establish penalties for the members that violate them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Financial Fair Play requirements established for all leagues.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://rachelbrandon.com/how-to-remove-bribery-from-fifas-world-cup-selection-process/">No more blind draws</a> to determine World Cup Pools.
  </li>
  <li>
    NO MORE SECRET BALLOTS FOR ANYTHING. If the last FIFA election were public, would Blatter have been reelected that easily?
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2-establish-the-fifa-world-of-futbol-resort">2. Establish the “FIFA World of Futbol Resort”</h4>

<ul style="margin-top: 0;">
  <li>
    It is no longer a viable option for the host of FIFA tournaments to alternate between different countries. Economic studies show this to be a poor investment by the host country, unless the infrastructure already exist. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlJEt2KU33I">Just watch this</a>.) In addition, the FBI allegations are showing t<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/03/us-soccer-fifa-idUSKBN0OI22P20150603">he most corrupt aspect of FIFA</a> is the bidding process for hosting World Cups. What I suggest is removing the bidding process completely by removing the hosts.
  </li>
  <li>
    But how can this happen? No fear, I have a solution. FIFA should build a year round complex where all FIFA sponsored international tournaments are played. Think of it as Flushing Meadows (of US Open fame) but for futbol. Or Disney World for futbol fans.
  </li>
  <li>
    It would consist of a main stadium (60k seats) with four more secondary stadiums (35k seats) and training fields. Also needed would be an airport, a bunch of hotels, restaurants, campgrounds, hostels, beaches, and the FIFA Hall of Fame.
  </li>
  <li>
    A resort like this will take time to build, but would be ready for World Cup 2022.
  </li>
  <li>
    It would make a crap load of money for FIFA.
  </li>
  <li>
    On my watch, the women’s World Cup would never ever be played on artificial turf, because it’d be played at the FIFA resort &#8211; on the nicest natural surface the billions in FIFA’s coffers can buy.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3-establish-a-consistent-calendar-for-clubs-and-countries">3. Establish a consistent calendar for clubs and countries</h4>

<ul style="margin-top: 0;">
  <li>
    There’s no need for clubs and countries to fight over players.
  </li>
  <li>
    Establishment of an 8-10 week international period per year when all international matches are held.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="4-update-thelaws-of-the-game-forthe-21st-century">4. Update the laws of the game for the 21st century</h4>

<ul style="margin-top: 0;">
  <li>
    Establish a serious concussion protocol
  </li>
  <li>
    Video replays for goals including onsides and offsides calls
  </li>
  <li>
    There has to be a better way to end tied matches than penalty kicks. Has to.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="5-most-importantly-id-right-the-moral-wrong-and-remove-the-2022-world-cup-from-qatar-for-theirovert-disregard-of-human-life">5. Most importantly, I’d right the moral wrong and remove the 2022 World Cup from Qatar for their <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2014/country-chapters/qatar">overt disregard of human life</a>.</h4>

<p>To conclude, it is my desire, <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/5/29/8688243/fifa-president-sepp-blatter-proclaims-himself-president-of-everybody">unlike the deep down intentions of my eventual predecessor</a>, to be the president of everyone. Therefore, I’m opening up this platform to the citizens of the planet to help me shape and improve these ideas. Thank you for your support and <em>I believe that I can win</em>.</p>
