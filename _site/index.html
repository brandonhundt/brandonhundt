        </h3><p>Winters can get a bit cold in Minnesota so some downtown business owners thought it was wise to build random walkways connecting buildings to one another. The Minneapolis Skyway System was born. “The Skyway” is a convoluted and confusing collection of intra-building walkways that connects 2nd floors (and sometimes first floors) of most of, but not all of the buildings in Downtown Minneapolis. If Wikipedia is accurate, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis_Skyway_System">11 miles worth of skyways</a> – making it the largest skyway system in THE WORLD.<!--more--></p>

It’s a confusing system! A literal skyway map is a mess any which way you try to attempt it. Just think of the layers of the skyway, you have streets, buildings, and the actual skyways, that zig and zag through a building.<!--more--></p>

While I was relieved that my home city of Minneapolis wasn’t on Mars’ worst list, I also couldn’t tell you what our flag looked like. Thats not good. A good flag will be flown.<!--more--></p>

Being someone that is typically <a href="http://rachelbrandon.com/tag/sports-reform/" rel="external">pro rule change</a> this is music to my ears. However, Goodell’s proposal  just feels wrong. Here it is summed up: A touchdown is automatically worth 7 points, unless the scoring teams attempts to run an additional play for an attempt at an additional point, but if that play is unsuccessful you lose a point. Please try to explain that to a non-football fan. It would just add to an increasingly confusing and over regulated rule book.</p>

            Unnecessary Book Review: Baby Touch and Feel Animals
          </a>
        </h3><p>As a new dad, I have been exposed to a new world of books. Namely, books designed for babies. My daughter is now nearly five months old and is beginning to touch everything and put everything into her mouth. I’m beginning to learn that the baby book industry (aka ‘Big Baby Book’) is catering to this high demand. Pages are typically indestructible and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">edible</span> chewable.<!--more--></p>

            The World Basketball Cup: A Tournament to Save the NBA

        </h3><p>This past Saturday, I decided to watch the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EuroBasket_2011">EuroBasket</a> tournament semi-finals and finals <a href="http://rachelbrandon.com/redrawing-ncaa-college-football-the-end-of-the-amateur-ideal/">instead of NCAA football</a>. It was exciting basketball played at a high quality. Spain is simply an incredible team, featuring the Gasol brothers and four other current NBA players (and a few former ones too). They ended up defeating Tony Parker, Joakim Noah, Nicolas Batum, and the rest of France in the title game. That’s a lot of talent. It proves that the the rest of the world is catching up to US.<!--more--></p>

This figures to be the NCAA’s next installment of the “We will let you play today and collect all the money from the game, but will take the result away from the winning team three to five years down the road because some player who will then be in the NFL will posthumously be declared ineligible BOWL.” Oh I can’t wait!<!--more--></p>

During the times I sat shotgun,  I remember being ready to cross another state off the list as soon as we saw a new plate. This was always fun and exciting for me as I have always been a bit of a political geography junkie.<!--more--></p>

        </h3><p>In the last two days there were two exciting soccer matches that went down to the wire to see the favorite lose on penalties. One was the Women’s World Cup final with Japan defeating the U.S. The other was a strong Uruguay team defeating a supposedly world class Argentinian team on Argentine soil in the quarterfinals of the Copa America. These were thrilling matches, where all four of the teams deserved victories, yet I have to question if taking penalties is the way to decide the outcome in World Class competitions.<!--more--></p>

I would like the readership to know that I’m prepared to stand behind, on top of, or in the map I redrew with a few adjustments based on the received feedback.<br />

Naturally, I wanted to learn more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh" rel="external">Pittsburgh</a> (Geography nerd tag). Through Wikipedia (I didn’t mention thorough readings), I learned that Pittsburghians do not necessarily associate with the state of Pennsylvania. They are located at the edge of the Midwest, Northeast, Rust Belt, and Appalachia. One person even called them the ‘Paris of Appalachia’.<br />

I have to say that I am in favor of this. I am even in favor of going so far in creating an European Super League. I would much rather see a Barca/Arsenal match-up more often than watch Barca whoop up on another low-level Spanish club like Levante. And to think Barca could play Chelsea, Man United, Liverpool, AC Milan, Inter, and the likes of Bayern Munich on a weekly basis gets me excited.<!--more--></p>

        </h3>If you asked me what I would do if money weren't an option, I'd say NBA Commissioner. And as such, I will spell out in detail my major platform, so to speak, towards improving the quality of the NBA.
Go International

I have heard reports the NBA wants to expand into Europe by creating a new division with teams in London, Berlin, Barcelona, and Paris. This wouldn't work. Too much travel, and it doesn't allow for easy expansion from there. What I do think would work is that the NBA buy or work toward a merger with the Euroleague and the Chinese League (Austrailia). There has to be enough money in the NBA coffers to flat out purchase it. This will allow for the expansion of the game globally, new influence over FIBA, and essentially guarantee the NBA game is played in International Competitions.
