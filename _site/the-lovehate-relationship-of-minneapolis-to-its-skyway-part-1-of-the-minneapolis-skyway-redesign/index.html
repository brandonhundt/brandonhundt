<p>Take that <strong>EVERY OTHER CITY</strong>.</p>

<p>I work in downtown Minneapolis and if I‚Äôm being honest, I can sense a real <a href="https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/minneapolis-skyways-plan-future">love/hate</a> relationship Minneapolitans have with their skyway. Time for a pro/con list:</p>

<p><strong>PROs:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The skyways are heated. Often times I can even forgo the coat on my walk to grab a lunch or simply stretch the legs on a sub-zero day. I should note, the nearest skyway entrance to my office is across a street. If I were skyway connected, coats are not necessary.</li>
  <li>They help MPLS stay fit in the winter and this is a <a href="https://www.americanfitnessindex.org/?city=minneapolis-mn">super fit city</a>. I should add that no foray into the skyway is complete without seeing a group of coworkers venting about spreadsheets while on a power walk.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.downtownmpls.com/news_article/show/435964-where-did-the-mighty-ducks-shoot-scenes-in-downtown-minneapolis-">The Mighty Ducks rollerbladed</a> through them once.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôm not sure Minneapolis gets to host next year‚Äôs Super Bowl without them. I can only imagine how cranky sport journalists already are about coming to Minneapolis for a week in early February. But knowing they can leave their coats in their hotel room on the way to the stadium has to be at least a little comforting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>CONs:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The skyways take people off the streets making them feel empty at times.</li>
  <li>They can be much much slower than just walking on the street.</li>
  <li>There‚Äôs an argument that they hurt retail. So much so that a boutique retailer, of the Dayton (Target) fortune, has started a <a href="https://mspmag.com/shop-and-style/ali-shops/the-oath-of-the-skyway-avoidance-society/">skyway avoidance society</a>.</li>
  <li>The skyway enables and allows Minneapolis to host the Super Bowl in our brand new, billion dollar, mostly taxpayer funded, Viking ship-ish looking, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/u-s-bank-stadium-officials-plan-three-year-300-000-bird-fatality-study/386676761/">bird concussion provider</a>. Even with the skyways, sports journalists are still going to hate the idea of a cold weather, Minneapolis Super Bowl. Get ready for <a href="https://theringer.com/37-pre-super-bowl-hours-in-houston-d1627b7c8f52#.jkdlg0nh3">The Ringer‚Äôs takedown</a>. You thought <a href="https://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/new-york-times-minnesota-grape-salad/">#grapegate</a> was bad and appalling - just you wait. Prepare yourself.</li>
  <li>Most importantly, the skyways are extremely difficult to navigate with ugly and unhelpful maps and signage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Seriously here is the official Skyway map:</p>

  <img class="size-large wp-image-1260" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/23161166002_c940553345_o-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Skyway Map" width="640" height="360" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/23161166002_c940553345_o-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/23161166002_c940553345_o-1-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/23161166002_c940553345_o-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />

<p>And here is an example of the signage:</p>

<div id="attachment_1261" class="wp-caption alignnone">

    Exhibit B: Why the texture? Credit: Flickr/Creative Commons
  </p>
</div>

<p>Seriously. Ugh. Everything is wrong. Its like these were done in the 90‚Äôs when Photoshop first came out and someone realized they could make water-like textures - so they did. Let‚Äôs just say that we can do better Minneapolis - much better! And we need to do better for the sports writers that are about to descend on us in a year.</p>

<p>Fortunately the map and signage are fixable, and I‚Äôve taken this project on. <a href="/make-the-skyway-map-great-for-the-first-time-part-2-of-the-minneapolis-skyway-redesign-project">In Part 2</a>, I present my map and explain in great lengths why its necessary to do it how I did. <a href="/better-signage-for-the-skyway-part-3-of-the-minneapolis-skyway-redesign">In Part 3</a>: I offer my suggestion for signage to accompany the map.</p>
