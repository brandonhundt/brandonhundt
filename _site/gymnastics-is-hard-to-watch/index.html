        <p>Let’s cut to the chase, gymnastics is bothering me more than in previous Olympics. I’ll admit, I really respect the work ethic and skill that these athletes display. Yet, <em>Gymnastics just feels hard</em>. Would you believe a gymnast if they said it is fun? I don’t. And that’s just the beginning of my troubles.<!--more--></p>

<p>Until the Beijing games, gymnasts had to earn their score. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Points_(artistic_gymnastics)">When scandal ripped through the sport</a> after Athens (were we shocked?), the days of the Perfect 10 were declared over. Now we are left with a system in which an athlete begins with a perfect score for an element based on difficulty. And then we watch the judges subtract points like its Facebook stock.</p>

<p><em>Subtraction is harder than addition.</em></p>

<p>When watching gymnastics, we are watching teenagers not wanting to fail. You can just sense the tension in the arena. I can see the look in their faces, <em>just don’t screw this up</em>. This is not a good tension. It’s not the same tension that is there before a game winning field goal or penalty kick or final event in the Heptathlon. It’s stress.</p>

<p><em>Stress is hard on the mind and negatively affects performance.</em></p>

<p>Also, the artistic performance used to be a factor in the old system. Granted this sometimes went over the top, but it made events like the floor exercise a bit more exciting. In the current scoring system all a gymnast needs to do is complete the events like a robot. There are no more hand movements and dance elements.</p>

<p><em>Where the is no art, life is harder.</em></p>

<p>Maybe I’m just tired of hearing the word deduction for two straight weeks.</p>

<p><em>Gymnastics is just hard to watch.</em></p>

<h2 id="bonus-reasons-why-gymnastics-is-hard-to-watch">Bonus reasons why Gymnastics is hard to watch:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Seriously only two competitors from a country can compete in the all-around, even if three had the top three qualifying scores? Bogus.</li>
  <li>A tie goes to the person who had fewer deductions, meaning it goes to the person who played it safer. Take a cue from swimming, let them share the medal!</li>
  <li>Also, doesn’t it feel like gymnastics events are in the wrong order? I think they should start with the individual apparatuses. It would introduce us to the competitors and allow a healthy tension to build before the big events (the all-around and team). It’s kind of like how Nascar starts with Daytona and can’t get the general public to follow the rest of the season.</li>
</ul>

<p>—</p>

<h2 id="bonus-video">Bonus Video…</h2>

<p>Two top notch routines, one from the era of Perfect 10s, one from the new scoring era. Do you see what I’m seeing?</p>

<p>NOTE: Gabby Douglas is performing the same routine she uses in the Olympics</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Please let comment below if your disdain for gymnastics is equal to or greater than mine! And if you disagree, even better.</p>
