**_UPDATE: After feedback on this design, I iterated and came up with a design I&#8217;m much happier with. Please [visit the new post](http://rachelbrandon.com/the-latest-design-for-a-new-minnesota-flag-is-inspired-by-letoile-du-nord/)._**<!--more-->

I just had a so much fun redesigning the flag for the city of Minneapolis that I felt inspired to redesign the flag for the great state of Minnesota. Same rules apply. You can find them in my [Minneapolis flag post](http://rachelbrandon.com/adventures-in-vexillology-a-new-flag-for-minneapolis/)&#8230;

Lets cut to the chase. The Minneapolis state flag violates nearly all of the rules of accepted vexillogical design guidelines. It contains a seal and text, it has more than three colors, its not very simple, and its not very symbolic or distinctive. Needless to say, its time for the state of Minnesota to have a flag it is proud to fly.

Look at this way. In the oft chance we were to secede from the Union, would this be the flag that unites the now sovereign state of Minnesota? I think not.

As I mentioned in my Minneapolis post, I’ve been inspired [by the work of Zeus Jones](http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/minnesota_united_fc.php) and their logo for Minnesota United FC. I feel it captures Minnesota quite well and displays many flag-like qualities. Its quite a brilliant logo. The loon illustration is just so damn good that I feel its worthy of the state flag.

The loon evokes reminiscence of [two of my favorite flags](http://rachelbrandon.com/adventures-in-vexillology-the-top-10-best-designed-flags/), Albania and Uganda, that also feature majestic avian creatures. Especially note double eagle of the Albanian flag.

With this inspiration, here is my proposal for the new flag of Minnesota:

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1136" src="http://rachelbrandon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/new-flag-mn-300x190.png" alt="new-flag-mn" width="300" height="190" srcset="https://rachelbrandon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/new-flag-mn-300x190.png 300w, https://rachelbrandon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/new-flag-mn.png 476w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://rachelbrandon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/new-flag-mn.png)

Its a white based flag representing our collective embrace of winter. A light blue diagonal sash for the many many waterways and rivers of the land. But the best part of this flag features two of Zeus Jones’ loons mingling in front of the North Star; evoking a sense of awe, beauty, and yet strength. I&#8217;m reminded of a lyric in the song [_Minneapolis_ by Ben Kyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0SdiIl8-qs):

“Oh Minneapolis, I saw you and Saint Paul kiss underneath the moonlight in the Mississippi mist. I never saw a thing as beautiful as this”

This flag evokes a feeling of place and I’d proudly fly this flag at my home. Here’s the question, would you?
