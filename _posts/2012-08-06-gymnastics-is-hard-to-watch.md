Let’s cut to the chase, gymnastics is bothering me more than in previous Olympics. I’ll admit, I really respect the work ethic and skill that these athletes display. Yet, _Gymnastics just feels hard_. Would you believe a gymnast if they said it is fun? I don’t. And that’s just the beginning of my troubles.<!--more-->

Until the Beijing games, gymnasts had to earn their score. [When scandal ripped through the sport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Points_(artistic_gymnastics)) after Athens (were we shocked?), the days of the Perfect 10 were declared over. Now we are left with a system in which an athlete begins with a perfect score for an element based on difficulty. And then we watch the judges subtract points like its Facebook stock.

_Subtraction is harder than addition._

When watching gymnastics, we are watching teenagers not wanting to fail. You can just sense the tension in the arena. I can see the look in their faces, _just don’t screw this up_. This is not a good tension. It’s not the same tension that is there before a game winning field goal or penalty kick or final event in the Heptathlon. It’s stress.

_Stress is hard on the mind and negatively affects performance._

Also, the artistic performance used to be a factor in the old system. Granted this sometimes went over the top, but it made events like the floor exercise a bit more exciting. In the current scoring system all a gymnast needs to do is complete the events like a robot. There are no more hand movements and dance elements.

_Where the is no art, life is harder._

Maybe I’m just tired of hearing the word deduction for two straight weeks.

_Gymnastics is just hard to watch._

## Bonus reasons why Gymnastics is hard to watch:

  * Seriously only two competitors from a country can compete in the all-around, even if three had the top three qualifying scores? Bogus.
  * A tie goes to the person who had fewer deductions, meaning it goes to the person who played it safer. Take a cue from swimming, let them share the medal!
  * Also, doesn’t it feel like gymnastics events are in the wrong order? I think they should start with the individual apparatuses. It would introduce us to the competitors and allow a healthy tension to build before the big events (the all-around and team). It’s kind of like how Nascar starts with Daytona and can’t get the general public to follow the rest of the season.

## Bonus Video&#8230;

Two top notch routines, one from the era of Perfect 10s, one from the new scoring era. Do you see what I’m seeing?



NOTE: Gabby Douglas is performing the same routine she uses in the Olympics
